    <h2>About Me</h2><br>
    <p>Hello! I’m Cristina, a passionate web developer with a love for creating interactive, user-friendly websites. My journey began with a curiosity for how websites are built, which soon grew into a dedication to mastering HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and beyond. I enjoy bringing ideas to life online, crafting experiences that are both visually engaging and technically robust.

      Whether working on personal projects or collaborating with others, I’m always excited to learn, innovate, and tackle new challenges in the world of web development. When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me exploring new tech trends or experimenting with design ideas.
      
      Thanks for stopping by, and feel free to check out my projects!</p>
